# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for exchanging data, especially in web applications.

It is commonly used to:

* send data via [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP)  
* structure responses from REST APIs  
* store configurations  

[JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) and [Python](/wiki/Python) both work well with JSON.
