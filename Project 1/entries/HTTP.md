# HTTP

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication on the web.

It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various requests.

Common HTTP methods include

* GET  
* POST  
* PUT  
* DELETE  

The current version is HTTP/2, with HTTP/3 gaining adoption.
